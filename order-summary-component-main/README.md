## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Havent studied in a month due to life situations however I wanted to jump right into a project to see if my skills were still solidifed from months of learning. I engaged this project and it was suprisingly very straightforward. This is a very basic project with no Javascript involved .. but I wanted to see how quickly I can write HTML/CSS with Flexbox and get it going.

### Continued development

Continuing learning I wan't to start some of the Junior level projects on FrontendMentor and get working with Javascript more. I need to learn API's and working with API's to get ready for a career change into the web development field.
